### Laboratory H: Differential drive and communications (at home version)

**Before the lab**:
- Ensure you have read the lecture notes on PWM, H-bridges, motors and communication
- Review the L293 H-bridge datasheet: http://www.micropik.com/PDF/l293b.pdf
- Review the PWM section of the ATmega2560 datasheet (section 17, p133): http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2549-8-bit-AVR-Microcontroller-ATmega640-1280-1281-2560-2561_datasheet.pdf
- Review the communication sample provided at https://github.com/mxeng/mcp-docs/blob/master/code-examples/comms_sample_controller.c


Task:
- Using a short piece of hookup wire, connect the RX2 and TX2 pins of your microcontroller together.
- Compile and upload the communication sample file as controller.c, verify that the communication works as expected using the serial terminal. **(H1)**
- This is showing how microcontroller to microcontroller communication can be implemented. Because you only have one Arduino at home, you are sending and receiving from the same microcontroller. But if you have two, you can connect RX2 of one to TX2 of the other, and vice-versa to communicate between the two devices. In the lab, we would use Xbee wireless modules to implement wireless communication between two microcontrollers.
- Change your communication protocol to send the two joystick channels in the two message bytes. Note that the values will need to be scaled, as the ADC will give you a 10 bit number (0-1023) while the communication protocol requires a value from 0-253. Explain the communication protocol in your lab book. **(H2)**
- Verify you can read these values correctly on the serial terminal. **(H3)**
- Mix the joystick values to produce a differential drive: 
  - joystick forward should result in left motor forward and right motor forward
  - joystick back should result in left motor back and right motor back
  - joystick left should result in left motor back and right motor forward
  - joystick right should result in left motor forward and right motor back
- Show the calculations required to convert the two joystick signals into suitable PWM comparison and direction values for the left motor and right motor. **(H4)**
- Demonstrate a working differential drive system with smooth control of both motors (with one motor, demonstrate both sides of the H bridge chip. **(H5)**
