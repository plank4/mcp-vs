# Lab Assessments

In this unit 40% for the marks awarded in this unit will be available through continuous assessment during the labs as outlined in the lab documentation. 

Each lab must be completed during the assigned tuition week, ie. Lab 1, teaching wk 1, after which marks will no longer be able to be claimed. The laboratories are designed such that preparation needs to be made prior to the lab in order to complete all the tasks. 

Each laboratory will have three demonstration marks which are assessed in lab groups and two report marks which are individually marked. Report marks must be presented in a physical notebook or as a printed version of a digital notebook, these must be presented prior to the last 30 minutes of the laboratory.

The last three weeks of semester do not have any laboratories attached to them, instead they will be used to prepare for the final assessment of the cart in the semi-autonomous challenge worth 40% of the marks for the unit.
